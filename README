Molniya is an instant messaging interface for Nagios. It relays alerts
to Nagios contacts in a convenient way; it also allows you to ask for
a status report, force checks, acknowledge faults, and more.

Requirements:
 * A Unix/Linux system running Nagios 3.
 * An XMPP server and user account; Google Talk works.
 * An SMTP server to relay outgoing mail.
 * Ruby 1.8 with the following gems:
  * metaid
  * xmpp4r
  * sinatra
  * rack
  * mongrel


Molniya setup:

1. Install the required gems listed above.
2. Copy the sample configuration in example.yaml and fill in appropriate
   values for the various settings. See the comments in example.yaml for
   guidance.
3. Configure your Nagios IM contacts with their IM addresses (XMPP JIDs)
   in the selected xmpp_field; I use address1.
4. Launch the server:
   $ ./molniya config.yaml
5. Connect to your XMPP server as the Molniya account and add your own
   IM account as a contact.

It should now be working; check by sending it the message 'status'. It
should reply with a status report of current faults, or the message
"All clear." If so, you're all set.


Nagios notification setup:

The included 'notify' utility is used as a Nagios notification command
to send messages through Molniya via XMPP or SMTP. The file
'notify.cfg' contains the appropriate command definitions; edit the
path as appropriate for your installation.

To actually use this notification method, configure Nagios contacts to
use the 'molniya-notify' and 'molniya-host-notify' commands as
service_notification_commands and host_notification_commands. See the
comments in notify.cfg for an example and discussion.


Usage:

Send the message 'help' for a summary of commands.

Also, there are simple administrative roster-management commands:

admin list-roster: prints a list of IM contacts
admin add <JID> <ALIAS>: add JID as a contact with alias ALIAS
admin remove <JID>: remove JID as a contact


Caveats:

This has been developed as an in-house application. It has only been
used with one Nagios installation on Solaris. It should work in other
environments but this is untested so far; let me know how it works out
for you.


Bugs:

The XHTML-IM usage is problematic with some IM clients.

TODO:
 * Provide SMF manifest (and init script) for running as a service.
 * Set up reasonable logging instead of writing everything to stderr.
 * Refactor the incredibly primitive command handling.
 * Improve many aspects of the code.
