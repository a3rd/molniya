= Status =

Right now, Molniya is designated 0.1. That's probably a bit low, considering that it's in operational use as it is. However, there are some serious deficiencies to address before it rates a 1.0 designation in my opinion.

= For 1.0 =

 * Handle message formatting in a more modular and customizable way.
 * Track problems reported while users are offline and summarize those that are still problems when they return. (in progress) [http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=1 Issue 1]
 * Add a fuller set of commands for scheduling downtime, state stalking, custom notifications, etc. (in progress) Issues [http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=2 2], [http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=3 3]
 * Lots of things are very service-centric and don't deal with host problems. (in progress) [http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=4 Issue 4]
 * General code improvements to rationalize the handling of contacts, etc.
 * Test on Linux. [http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=5 Issue 5]
 * Provide [http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=7 SMF manifest] and [http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=8 init script] for Solaris and Linux respectively.
