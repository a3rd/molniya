NOTE: this project needs a new owner! The original author is no longer running Nagios; if you'd like to carry the torch, get in touch, or fork away.

Molniya presents an IM interface for Nagios, so you can receive and react to problem notifications from Nagios in a convenient way. It uses XMPP (as well as SMTP) for communications. In addition to receiving notifications, you can request status reports, check services, and acknowledge outages.

Version 0.3 collects many fixes and improvements; all users should upgrade.

Molniya has been in daily use and works reliably and well. The author used to use it as his primary Nagios notification mechanism.

See MolniyaFeatures for details on its capabilities, and GettingStarted for setup information.

Also, there is an emerging RoadMap for future development.
