# Status #

Right now, Molniya is designated 0.1. That's probably a bit low, considering that it's in operational use as it is. However, there are some serious deficiencies to address before it rates a 1.0 designation in my opinion.

# For 1.0 #

  * Handle message formatting in a more modular and customizable way.
  * Add a fuller set of commands for scheduling downtime, state stalking, custom notifications, etc. (in progress) Issues [2](http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=2), [3](http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=3)
  * Lots of things are very service-centric and don't deal with host problems. (in progress) [Issue 4](http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=4)
  * General code improvements to rationalize the handling of contacts, etc.
  * Test on Linux. [Issue 5](http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=5)
  * Provide [SMF manifest](http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=7) and [init script](http://code.google.com/p/molniya/issues/detail?id=8) for Solaris and Linux respectively.
